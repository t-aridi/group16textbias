# group16textbias

Repository for Group 16's TextBias spin-off paper. Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis & the PDF of our final paper generated on Overleaf.

You can't access the Colab notebooks on here-- you have to go to Colab, Upload, Upload from Github, then give it the link to the repo. You should be able to choose what notebook in this repo you want to access.
